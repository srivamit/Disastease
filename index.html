    <p>Our team of six members is working on creating a disaster management website using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. We have chosen Pencode as our UI framework because of its simplicity and ease of use. The website's design is intentionally kept simple because during a disaster, the last thing people need is a complicated website that adds to the chaos. Our website will have several unique features, including a real-time disaster tracker, which will provide live updates about the disaster's location and its impact. We will also have an SOS feature that allows users to send a distress signal with their location to nearby authorities and emergency responders. Additionally, we will have a resource directory that provides information on shelters, food and water distribution centers, and other critical resources during a disaster. Overall, our goal is to create a user-friendly, informative, and helpful website that can assist people during times of crisis.</p>

  <h1>Welcome to Disastease</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p><i>Disasters can strike at any moment, and they can be caused by natural forces or human activity. From earthquakes and hurricanes to riots and landslides, disasters can take many forms and have devastating effects on people and communities. While it's natural to feel anxious and worried during a disaster, it's important to take proper measures to protect yourself and your loved ones. This includes staying informed about the situation, following emergency protocols, and having a plan in place for evacuation or sheltering in place. By being prepared and taking necessary precautions, you can minimize the impact of a disaster and ensure the safety of yourself and others.</i></p>

    <p="color: blue;"><h3>Manipur Riot:</h3><i>The large-scale communal riots that have spread like wildfire in Manipur since May 3 are deeply disturbing and have exposed the collapse of law and order in the state. The immediate spark for the violence was provided by the retaliatory destruction of the Anglo-Kuki War Memorial Gate in Leisang and razing of Vaiphei houses in Kangvai village by Meitei mobs following the beating up of a Meitei driver whose tripper truck hit a bike and ran over a stock of water bottles kept for use by peaceful tribal protestors in Lamka on the same day. However, these riots seem to follow an established pattern witnessed in other parts of India. This pattern follows what Paul Brass calls an “institutionalised riot system” (IRS), wherein riots are prepared, activated and sustained with explanatory justifications.</i>
